# - This workflow creates a tag with the format "release@<timestamp>" on the main branch.
# - It is triggered manually from the GitHub Actions UI.
# - It is only allowed to run on the main branch and ensures that the tag is created
#   on the main branch in the checkout step and with a verification step.
#   This is only to prevent accidental creation of the tag on other branches and cannot be used to prevent malicious creation of the tag.
